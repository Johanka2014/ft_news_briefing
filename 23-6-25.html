                        <p><strong>Kasia Broussalian:</strong> The US bombed three nuclear sites in Iran over the weekend. The attack marks a major escalation in the conflict, which had so far only involved Iran and Israel. It also marks a huge political gamble for US President Donald Trump. My colleague, Steff Chávez, has been covering the story from Washington. Hey, Steff.</p>
                        <p><strong>Steff Chávez:</strong> Hey, Kasia.</p>
                        <p><strong>Kasia Broussalian:</strong> So we know that Trump had spent the last week or so weighing military action. He said on Thursday that he’d take up to 14 days or so to decide what to do. Do we know why he moved up the timeline?</p>
                        <p><strong>Steff Chávez:</strong> I mean, we can probably say that it was never an actual two-week timeline, but was kind of a mechanism for him to buy himself a few days and maybe even catch the Iranians by surprise. And then his decision also came after some of the US’s European allies negotiated directly with Iranian officials in Switzerland. I talked to one former Pentagon official who speculated that those unsuccessful EU talks were the final straw for Trump.</p>
                        <p><strong>Kasia Broussalian:</strong> And what do we know about the mission itself and whether or not it was effective?</p>
                        <p><strong>Steff Chávez:</strong> So right now, the Pentagon is saying that the strikes inflicted severe damage on Iran’s nuclear facilities, but there’s still a full damage assessment pending.</p>
                        <p><strong>Kasia Broussalian:</strong> Now, speaking of Israel, Iran has traded a barrage of missile attacks with the country recently, but what sort of options does Tehran now have to respond to this US bombing?</p>
                        <p><strong>Steff Chávez:</strong> So on one hand, Israel has been really effective in weakening Iran militarily... But despite that weakening, you know, there still are missiles that Iran can launch at US troops deployed in the Middle East. They could try to close the Strait of Hormuz... There could be new strikes by Iranian proxies. And then of course they could continue to attack Israel. Yesterday morning after the US strikes were complete, Iran struck Israel and came out and said that it was in retaliation for Washington’s attacks.</p>
                        <p><strong>Kasia Broussalian:</strong> So the military operation brings very real risks... But what about for Trump himself? How big of a political gamble is it for the US?</p>
                        <p><strong>Steff Chávez:</strong> It’s a huge political gamble. He campaigned for his second term on a promise of being a peacemaker to end America’s forever wars, but these strikes risk drawing the US into a longer conflict... this does risk becoming a protracted conflict... there were some lawmakers who questioned whether the president actually had the authority to do this.</p>
                        <p><strong>Kasia Broussalian:</strong> ...are we seeing echoes here of the past in this latest US attack?</p>
                        <p><strong>Steff Chávez:</strong> I think we’re absolutely seeing echoes of the past. I was talking to former Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall last night, and he told me every time we’ve tried to shift to strategically more important regions since 2001, violence originating in the Middle East has sucked the US back in. He said, here we go again.</p>

                        <p><strong>Kasia Broussalian:</strong> Lines snaked around the block when Moscow’s first McDonald’s opened in 1990. Now decades later, the golden arches are gone. The company left after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but it’s since been replaced by a local knock-off. Here to explain what this new burger chain signals about the Russian economy is the FT’s special correspondent for eastern Europe, Courtney Weaver.</p>
                        <p><strong>Courtney Weaver:</strong> So the knock-off McDonald’s has a name. It’s called Vkusno i tochka, which roughly translates as tasty and that’s it... And they sold the business to one of their franchisees... And since then, it’s been kind of a bonanza for the business. They’re actually doing better in Russia than they were when they were under McDonald’s ownership.</p>
                        <p><strong>Kasia Broussalian:</strong> Well, explain the process of leaving Russia a bit more. What exactly happened when McDonald’s and other western brands pulled out?</p>
                        <p><strong>Courtney Weaver:</strong> So over the past three years, we’ve seen a lot of Western companies leave Russia... I think everyone had this kind of idea in the back of the mind — that maybe one day the war would end... And a lot of companies that left... left with a 10-year option to buy back the business. And what we’re seeing now is a lot of these businessmen that bought the businesses — they’re not so eager to sell the business back to the original owners. And they wanna make sure that these buyback clauses are nullified, and McDonald’s is a prime example of that.</p>
                        <p><strong>Kasia Broussalian:</strong> And why are these knock-off companies... so keen to keep the western brands out?</p>
                        <p><strong>Courtney Weaver:</strong> ...the Russian government is ploughing all this money into the war, which has created all these new industries, obviously, that has lifted up salaries across the board... a lot of Russians have a lot more money in their pockets... and companies like Vkusno i tochka have been the one to benefit. And so you can see why these new owners would be a little bit reluctant to see that go away.</p>
                        <p><strong>Kasia Broussalian:</strong> All right, so these firms are looking to the Russian government to help them out here. Do you think Moscow is going to?</p>
                        <p><strong>Courtney Weaver:</strong> Yeah, so in May Putin held a meeting with a lot of executives... And Putin indicated he had already asked the Duma... to start working on a bill that would address this issue...</p>
                        <p><strong>Kasia Broussalian:</strong> ...What does that tell us about how the Russian economy is changing?</p>
                        <p><strong>Courtney Weaver:</strong> The economy has really changed... Before the war, Russia was really an export-driven economy, and, obviously, sanctions have crippled that. What we’re seeing is kind of a return, in some ways, to the old Soviet economy, where domestic manufacturing is playing a much bigger role... there’s been a huge pivot towards China... And, as a result, Russia’s economy has become more isolationist.</p>
