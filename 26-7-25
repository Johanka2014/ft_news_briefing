                        <p><strong>Marc Filippino:</strong> Some critics say the Ukrainian government is becoming less democratic. Police have raided the homes of well-known public figures. They have also helped loyal people get government jobs. This has made activists, diplomats, and the media worried. At the same time, the country is trying hard to get weapons from Western countries for its war against Russia... Here to explain this is the FT’s Ukraine correspondent, Chris Miller. Hey, Chris.</p>
                        <p><strong>Christopher Miller:</strong> Hey, Marc.</p>
                        <p><strong>Marc Filippino:</strong> So let's start with the police raids. Why are people so angry?</p>
                        <p><strong>Christopher Miller:</strong> Sure. Last Friday morning, the State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) was doing two different raids. One raid was in Kyiv, at the office and home of the former infrastructure minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov. Another raid was in the city of Kharkiv, at the family home of a famous anti-corruption activist, Vitaliy Shabunin. These men are accused of doing illegal things, but they both say the accusations are false. They believe the raids happened for political reasons.</p>
                        <p><strong>Marc Filippino:</strong> So these two men are part of a group that is unhappy with President Zelenskyy. Why are they unhappy with him?</p>
                        <p><strong>Christopher Miller:</strong> Well, they worry that Zelenskyy and his office have too much power and are using it in a bad way. They also worry about corruption during the war. Because everyone is focused on the war, some important changes needed for Ukraine to join the European Union have been forgotten.</p>
                        <p><strong>Marc Filippino:</strong> What will happen to Zelenskyy and the war if more people stop supporting him?</p>
                        <p><strong>Christopher Miller:</strong> We are seeing that the unity in Ukraine is starting to break. Part of this is because people are very tired. The war has been going on for three and a half years and it is causing many problems. This move towards a less democratic government increases the risk of problems inside the country. The security services warn this could be very bad.</p>

                        <p><strong>Marc Filippino:</strong> Israel now has the world's best stock market. This is mostly because the country's economy is growing very fast. This is happening even with the conflict in Gaza and bombing in nearby countries. So, with so much criticism, why isn't the Israeli stock market changing more? Here to talk about it is FT columnist Ruchir Sharma.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ruchir Sharma:</strong> Hey, Marc.</p>
                        <p><strong>Marc Filippino:</strong> So, how well is the Israeli stock market doing?</p>
                        <p><strong>Ruchir Sharma:</strong> Well, one fact really surprised me. Since the conflict began on October 7th, 2023, the Israeli stock market is up 80 per cent in dollar terms. That's more than any other developed market in the world. So, it is the best market over the last 21 months.</p>
                        <p><strong>Marc Filippino:</strong> Yes, that is surprising. Why weren't investors affected by all of this? Why did they buy more in the Israeli market?</p>
                        <p><strong>Ruchir Sharma:</strong> I think the market sent a message. One message was that the conflict was not going to last, and Israel was going to win. The second thing is that it shows the strength of Israel's economy, which is technology. Since October 2023, there has also been a big AI tech boom.</p>
                        <p><strong>Marc Filippino:</strong> But what about the criticism? Why hasn't that affected the Israeli economy or market?</p>
                        <p><strong>Ruchir Sharma:</strong> I think the markets only look at the economy and company profits. There is also a worldwide tech boom. We see a similar thing in the US. The economy has been strong, and I think it's because of the AI boom in America.</p>
                        <p><strong>Marc Filippino:</strong> Is there anything that could shake the markets in Israel?</p>
                        <p><strong>Ruchir Sharma:</strong> If there is a new conflict, or if the current one gets worse, the market will not like that. Also, if the interest in AI technology ends, the market would have a problem.</p>
